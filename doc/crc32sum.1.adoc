:manmanual: crc32sum

NAME
----
crc32sum - compute and check CRC32 message checksums


SYNOPSIS
--------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
crc32sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
show help and exit

*-v*::
show version number and exit

*-c*, *--check*::
read CRC32 sums from the FILE and check them

*-r*, *--recursive*::
generate CRC32 sums for all files in given directories

*-p*, *--progress*::
show a progressbar

The following options are useful only when verifying checksums:

*-q*, *--quiet*::
don't print OK for each successfully verified file

*-s*, *--status*::
don't output anything, status code shows success


DESCRIPTION
-----------
crc32sum is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum for each of
the given files or for data from standard input. It aims to work in the same
way as the `md5sum` or `sha1sum` utilities do.

WARNING
-------
Note that the CRC32 checksum is merely used for error detection in
transmission and storage. It is not intended to guard against the malicious
modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash).
