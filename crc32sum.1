.SH NAME
.B crc32sum
- compute and check CRC32 message checksums


.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY crc32sum
.OP -r
.OP -p
.RB [[ -c
.IR FILE ]
.OP -q
.RB [\& -s ]]
.RI [ "FILE" ]...
.YS


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B crc32sum
is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum (using the
.I 0xedb88320
polynomial) for each of the given files or for the data read from the
standard input. It aims to work more or less in the same way as the
.I md5sum
or
.I sha1sum
utilities do.


.SH OPTIONS
.B \-c
.IR FILE ,
.B \--check
.I FILE
.RS 4
Read CRC32 sums from the FILE and check them.
.RE

.BR \-r ,
.B \--recursive
.RS 4
Generate CRC32 sums for all files in given directories.
.RE

.BR \-p ,
.B \--progress
.RS 4
Show a progressbar.
.RE

.BR \-h ,
.B \--help
.RS 4
Show usage information and exit.
.RE

.BR \-v ,
.B \--version
.RS 4
Show version number and exit.
.RE

The following options are useful only when verifying checksums:

.BR \-q ,
.B \--quiet
.RS 4
Do not print OK for each successfully verified file.
.RE

.BR \-s ,
.B \--status
.RS 4
Do not output anything, status code shows success.

.SH WARNING
Note that the CRC32 checksum is merely used for error detection in
transmission and storage. It is not intended to guard against the malicious
modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash).
