CRC32 Checksum Checker
======================
This is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum for each of
the given files or for data from the standard input. It aims to work in the
same way as the ‘md5sum’ or ‘sha1sum’ utilities do.

!!! Note that the CRC-32 checksum is merely used for error detection in
transmission and storage. It is not intended to guard against the malicious
modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash). !!!


SIMD Optimisation
-----------------
By default, the program does not use SIMD optimisations. The optimisations
can be enabled using the ‘configure’ script:

  ./configure --enable-simd

However, it should be noted that support for this feature is more or less
experimental as the actual calculation is not a performance bottleneck when
reading data from a disk.
