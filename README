CRC32 Checksum Checker
======================
This is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum for each of
the given files or for data from standard input. It aims to work in the same
way as the `md5sum` or `sha1sum` utilities do.

!!! Note that the CRC-32 checksum is merely used for error detection in
transmission and storage. It is not intended to guard against the malicious
modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash). !!!
